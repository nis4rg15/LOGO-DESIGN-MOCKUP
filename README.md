**DESCRIPTION**
The task of designing a logo for a construction company that portrays its commitment to both modernization and tradition fell into my hands. I began brainstorming ideas for the logo, settling on one that portrays a house with scaffolding to represent the process of building. A yellow accent was added to symbolize the energy and momentum of the company.

With Figma, I created the house outlines using simple geometric shapes and a thick band of yellow very prominent in the background. For the company name, "CONSTRUCTION" I chose a clean, bold font for professionalism, and the tagline, "Building the Future, Restoring the Past," beneath it was written in a much softer font.

I balanced the whole composition while tweaking the layout so that every element aligned appropriately. I kept the color scheme rather simple, using only black, gray, and yellow, because I wanted it to be minimal yet hard-hitting. The logo is modern and quite meaningful, speaking out for what the company does effectively.
